# What is Version Control?

> Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time. Git is a popular version control system used in software development to manage and collaborate on code efficiently.

## Key Definitions

- `Local repository`: A directory on your computer containing code and files for a project.
- `Remote repository`: An online version of the local repository hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- `Cloning`: Making a copy of a repository in a new directory.
- `Commit`: A snapshot of the project's current state that you can revert to.
- `Branch`: A separate line of development used for working in isolation without affecting the main project.
- `Git merge`: Combining changes from different branches.
- `Git stash`: A temporary storage area for changes you don't want to commit immediately.
- `Staging area`: A cache that holds changes you want to commit next.
- `Push`: Sending your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository. It's like uploading your work to the cloud.
- `Pull`: Bringing changes from the remote repository to your local repository, keeping your project up to date with the latest changes made by others. It's like downloading updates from the cloud to your computer.
- `Pull request`: Asking others to review and potentially merge your changes into the main project. It's like requesting permission to add your changes to the main project.
- `Conflicts`: Conflicts occur in version control when two or more people make changes to the same part of a file, and the system can't automatically figure out how to merge those changes together. It's like when two people try to edit the same sentence in a document at the same time, and you need to decide which version to keep or how to combine them.
